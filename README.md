### Hi there 👋

I actively always build something. Mostly out of interest and to learn for deeper understanding or just doing something completely different.

I have deep professional experience with Golang, specifically in Web applications and near-real time data processing (withing the same second, I know, thats an eternity in computing terms! ;))

I generally publish most of my learning work under the AGPL v3 License.

I am engaged in communities around Golang and tech-entrepreneurs, giving advice to people around infrastructure and backend discussions.
